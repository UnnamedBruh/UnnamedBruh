# Hey there!
I'm `UnnamedBruh`, a GitHub user that usually likes making *many* repositories for fun, *only* because I feel like it.
I program in *JavaScript*, **Lua**, *`RobloxScript`* (**Lua**u), and **`Python`**. I don't have Roblox Studio on my laptop, but I read a lot of the Roblox documentary (**check it out**). I use JavaScript the most.
And for some reason, I use [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org) and Node.js (mostly TurboWarp) to make other graphics, too. I make sounds with [PenguinMod](https://penguinmod.com) and Node.js (because why not use a website? :D).
I use [Glitch](https://glitch.com) to host Node.js websites, because I usually think hosting Node.js sites on GitHub is a real pain (not trying to downgrade GitHub).
