# Hey there!
I'm `UnnamedBruh`, a GitHub user that usually likes making *many* repositories for fun, or for a real purpose (e.g. letting users interact with formats more easily).
I program in *JavaScript* (mostly JavaScript), and **Lua**. I use JavaScript the most, but I still know some of Lua.
And for some reason, I use [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org) and my [Image Editor](https://unnamedbruh.github.io/newer-image-editor/imageEditor.html) to create a few graphics. I make sounds with [PenguinMod](https://penguinmod.com).
